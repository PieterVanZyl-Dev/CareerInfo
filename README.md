# CareerInfo
CareerInfo was my Final Year Database Project that required me to implement an Oracle Database & MongoDB database to acheive something to help university students in South Africa.
A Webscrapper was also required to scrap data and upload it to the MongoDB collection.

I thought it would be a great idea to give IT students and graduates more information on what to expect as they start working;
What are the most popular langauges ?
What are the salary expectations in different cities ?
What langauges has the highest paid salary ? 
Furthermore to make it easy for users to add jobs that they like we include a favourite job option that stores their favourite job and allows them to access it in more detail and to be redirected to apply on the site where the data was scrapped.

Here is what the dashboard looks like that I designed and implemented using the MongoDB collection data.

Here is what the job details page looks like.

This shows the list of jobs a user can favourite and browser through. Allows has filtering and searching functionality on fields.
Allowing you to filter by whatever coloumn you fancy.

This project is unfortunately not hosted online as oracle autonomous warehouse wallets (secrets) and Azure Web Service Hosting are not integratable without paying a premium for the hosting, I even requested help from Oracle who told me I have implemented everything correctly and it should function as intended.
I'm considering merging this with another project, and switching away from the oracle autonomous warehouse so I showcase the live hosted site.
